## Team Members
We are a team of five enthusiastic Cisco cybersecurity engineers:
1. **Mohamad El Henawy** (Team Lead)
2. Mustafa Gomaa
3. Mohammed Quandel
4. Youssef Samuel
5. Abdallah Sleim

## Project Overview

**Title**: Building and Securing a Small Network  
**Platform**: Cisco Packet Tracer

Our project focuses on designing, implementing, and securing a small network for an organization. The tasks were divided among the team, and the network was fully tested for functionality, security, and performance.

## Tasks and Deliverables

### 1. **IP Addressing Table**
- Designed and documented a detailed IP addressing scheme for all network devices.

### 2. **Initial Configuration**
- Configured routers and switches with:
  - Hostnames
  - SSH-only access
  - Passwords
  - `no shutdown` commands
  - DHCP for dynamic IP allocation
  - Additional essential configurations for basic functionality

### 3. **OSPF Routing**
- Implemented **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)** for dynamic routing between network segments.

### 4. **VLANs and Inter-VLAN Routing**
- Configured:
  - VLANs for network segmentation
  - VLAN trunks
  - Inter-VLAN routing using the **Router-on-a-Stick** method

### 5. **Network Security**
- Enhanced security by implementing:
  - Port security
  - Access Control Lists (ACLs)
  - Basic firewall rules
- Secured routers and switches to mitigate unauthorized access and potential threats.

## Project Workflow

### Week 1: Network Design and Configuration
- Created the network topology, IP addressing scheme, and initial device configurations.

### Week 2: VLANs and Inter-VLAN Routing
- Implemented VLANs and established Inter-VLAN routing.

### Week 3: Network Security Implementation
- Applied security measures, including ACLs and basic firewall rules.

### Week 4: Final Testing and Reporting
- Conducted thorough testing for functionality, security, and performance.
- Prepared a final report and presentation.
